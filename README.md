# C# Exercises with Solutions

While I was searching for some exercises to improve my C# skills I came across with [this](https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/) site. I downloaded the website content and used a parser script that I wrote to create exercise interfaces so that I could use them in this project.

I solved almost 180 exercises and increased my coding speed while learning new built-in functions and some super-cool-stuff. In this project you can find solutions for C# algorithm  [exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/basic-algo/index.php) and for LinQ [exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/linq/index.php).
